.content-box-soft[ 
- Q1:Top four countries with the highest average number of deaths due to air pollution since 1990 to 2019.]

.content-box-soft[ 
- Q2:Is air pollution in these four countries improving until 2019? ]

.content-box-soft[

### Q1: Top four countries with the highest average number of deaths due to air pollution since 1990 to 2019.


```{r out.width='70%', echo=FALSE,fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/Screenshot_1.png")
```


The four countries with the highest average number of deaths (per 100,000) due to air pollution are Solomon Islands, Afghanistan, Central African Republic and Somalia.

### Q2: Is air pollution in these four countries improving until 2019?

```{r out.width='60%', echo=FALSE,fig.align='center'}

# Q3

.green[.bold[How about the outdoor air pollution for these countries?]] 

- Ozone, an atmospheric gas, is often called smog when at ground level. It is created when pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, industrial boilers, refineries, and other sources chemically react in the presence of sunlight.

- Particulate matter is created by vehicle and industrial emissions from fossil fuel combustion. Cigarette smoke, and burning organic matter, such as wildfires, all contain PM.

.content-box-duke-green[ 

- Air pollution is one of the leading risk factors for deaths across the world.
  
- In 2017, air pollution contributed for approximately 12 percent of global deaths.
  
- The burden of air pollution tends to be greater among low and middle income countries.

# Section 3 - Highest and Lowest Air Pollution
## Research Questions

.content-box-soft[ 
* Q1: Which country has the highest number of Air Pollution caused casualties? 
* And what is its trend across the year pertaining to their cause of deaths severity?
]

.content-box-soft[ 
* Q2: What is the 4 lowest polluted countries? 
* Regarding the comparison between them, what are possible reasons for these significantly low result?
]

## Analysis
## Research Question 1 - Graphic

.content-box-soft[ 
* Solomon Islands appears to be the most pollution-led casualties, given their significant amount of deaths over any other countries. 
]

```{r out.width = '50%', echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/Magic_Figure1.png")
```

.content-box-soft[ 
* With further exploration, Death from general Air Pollution is the most severe, similarly with Solid Fuels-led pollution.

## Research Question 1 - Research and Analysis

.content-box-soft[ 
* With heavily and ever-changing climate change risk, over-deforestation problem and enormous plastic waste issues, Solomon Islands is even more prone to bigger issues
